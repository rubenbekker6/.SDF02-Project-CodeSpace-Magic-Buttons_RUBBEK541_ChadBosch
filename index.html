        MAIN POINTS IN PROJECT BRIEF:
        
        Implement hover, focus, and click effects on buttons. 
        Implement hover effects for a delightful user hover experience.
        Focus on ensuring smooth and visually appealing transitions.
        Explore the use of @keyframes for more complex animations.
        Beyond the animation, ensure your buttons are styled elegantly. Think about their colour, typography, and overall design.
        Aim for a consistent theme across all three buttons, even if the animations differ.
        Your CSS will be bustling with activity. Ensure you comment on your code clearly, explaining the rationale behind your animation choices and any challenges you faced.
        If you're seeking an added layer of complexity, consider incorporating multiple animation properties, such as scale, rotate, or skew, in your buttons.
